## Using Src Directly?
Using src code directly (opposed to DLLs) can allow you to easily edit src and step-through via Visual Studio. If you want to swap your GS project from DLLs to src:

1. Backup (Git?)
2. CLOSE Unity (dll's persist while open)
3. Find your /GameSparks dir, and DELETE following files
```
/GameSparks
  ./Plugins
    ./GameSparks.Api.dll
    ./GameSparks.dll
    ./GameSparksRT.dll
```
4. Create dir `./src`
5. Drop everything from `/gs-csharp-community-sdk/Projects/` to the new `src` dir
6. Open `/src/bccrypto-csharp-1.8.1/crypto/src` -> Rename `AssemblyInfo.cs` to `AssemblyInfo.cs.bak` (it's a dupe).
7. Open `/src/Properties` -> Rename `AssemblyInfo.cs` to `AssemblyInfo.cs.bak` (it's a dupe).
8. Apply the [latest WebSocket patch](https://github.com/Imperium42/gs-csharp-community-sdk/issues/6)
9. Open Unity >> Refresh (CTRL+R), if necessary. 

âœ… You're using native C# src! You can now utilize step-thru debugging with GS src.

## TODO:
1. Full release instead of src+patch ([$500 AWS credits bounty](https://github.com/Imperium42/gs-csharp-community-sdk/issues/6) for pull request!)
